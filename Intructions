1) put the two .ks scripts in your scripts folder at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program\Ships\Script
(or wherever KSP is located on your computer)
2) make sure to be using the ship in the video, or else it may fail.
3) Press launch and once it loads open up both of the terminals on the ship.
4) On the Booster CPU type: runpath("0:/lander.ks").
5) Hit run, after that you can close the booster cpu terminal.
6) On the Command Module CPU type: runpath("0:/learn.ks").
7) Once you hit run it will countdown from 10.
8) Sit back and watch it run, with PRE (Physics Range Extender) you can run both the landing and the second stage at the same time.
I used that in the video but its not required.

If there is issues, write an issue and send it and ill see about it.

Made for KSP version 1.8 and 1.9, run at own risk at other versions.
